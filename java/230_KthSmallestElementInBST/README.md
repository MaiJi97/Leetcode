## Method 1: DFS / Inorder traverse
Use a helper function to traverse and store the elements in order in an array list. Since this is a BST the array list has already stored elements in ascending order, we can get the value directly by using get(k-1) method.
Time Complexity: O(n)

## Method 2: Stack
