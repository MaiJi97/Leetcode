## Method 1: Stack

A typical question that uses stack. We will need to compare the peek element on the stack with the current element to be popped, keep pushing element onto the stack if
they are not equal, or keep popping otherwise.

Time Complexity: O(n)

## Method 2: Stack Improved

A simplified version of the above method. Just push element onto the stack, and compare the peek element on the stack with the current element to be popped. Keep 
popping if they are equal.

Time Complexity: O(n)
