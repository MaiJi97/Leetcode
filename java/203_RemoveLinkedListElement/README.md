## Method 1: Iterative - Pointers

We create a dummy node at the beginning of the list in this problem in case the first element is the element we want to remove. Then we simply use a current pointer to iterate through the list and skip the element if it is the one we want to remove. </br>

Time Complexity:O(n)
