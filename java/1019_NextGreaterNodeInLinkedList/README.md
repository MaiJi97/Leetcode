## Method 1: Monotonic Stack

Similar approach as problem 496, but in linked list. We can iterate through the linked list and store elements into an array first and 
repeat the same operations as in problem 496, or we can also reverse the linked list so we can traverse the list from the end to the 
beginning as in problem 496.

Time Complexity: O(n)
