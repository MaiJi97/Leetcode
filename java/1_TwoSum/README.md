## Method 1: Brute Force

Use a nested for loop to look for the two numbers whose sum is the target value
Time Complexity: O(n^2)

## Method 2: HashMap
Use a map to store the value as key-pair. Key is the number and value is its index.
Need to clarify: is it sorted? is there duplicate? what to return if no solution?
Time Complexity: O(n)
