## Method 1: Two Pointers
Similar as the 3Sum question, we use a for loop and two pointers to go through the array and increment / decrement the two pointers to get a target value. </br>
In addition, we need a variable to track the value that is closest to the target value. </br>

Time Complexity: O(n)
