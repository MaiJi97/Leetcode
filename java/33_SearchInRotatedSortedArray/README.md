## Method 1: Find Pivot + Binary Search
Binary Search变形，first find pivot，which is the starting point of the rotated sorted array (smallest number in the array), then reset the two pointers of the sorted array in order to carry out an ordinary binary search. </br>

Time Complexity: O(logn)

## Method 2: Binary Search
Do the binary search direcly.

Time Complexity: O(logn)
