## Method 1: Two Pointers 同向双指针 - fast & slow

Similar as problem 56. Difference is that in 56 we need to compare each pair of adjacent intervals and check if there is intersection, but in this problem we only need to insert one interval into its correct position. There are three situations when we iterate through the intervals through one pointer: 1) if the interval to be inserted is at the back, then we do not need to do anything, just add the current interval to the list. 2) if the interval is already past, then do what we did in problem 56 as if there is no intersection. Add the current interval to the list and update the newInterval pointer. Why not just add the current interval directly? Because the new interval to be added may not only cover the current interval, but also next interval to be iterated. If that's the case we need to merge interval (repeat situation 3) multiple times, so we cannot add the new interval to the result immediately after the merge. Therefore, what we can do is only to update the new interval in situation 3, and add the new interval to the result when we completely pass over it in the current situation. 3) if it is the situation that we need to merge intervals (can have 4 cases, second half of slot1 with first half of slot2, first half of slot1 with second half of slot2, slot1 completely covers slot2, or slot 2 completely covers slot1), merge and update the newInterval.
