## Method 1: Stack implementation using Array

A traditional implementation of stack with an additional method increment. Fields we need to set include the array representation of the stack, the capacity of the stack and the pointer top which keeps track of the index of the last element on the stack. We set it to -1 here.

Time Complexity: </br>
Push: O(1) </br>
Pop: O(1) </br>
Increment: O(k) </br>
