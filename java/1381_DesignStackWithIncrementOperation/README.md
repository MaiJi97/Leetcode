## Method 1: Stack implementation using Array

A traditional implementation of stack with an additional method increment. Fields we need to set include the array representation of the stack, the 
capacity of the stack and the pointer top which keeps track of the next position we insert an element. We set it to 0 here, but can also use -1 as the 
position of the current element.

Time Complexity: O(k)
