## Method 1: Two Pointers 同向双指针 - fast & slow

Similar as problem 26, but will need to use a counter to count number of times a number repeat, and check different conditions (when the current element is same as 
previous element, need to check if it occurs within twice or more than twice).

Time Complexity: O(n)
