## Method 1: Two Pointers
Since the array is sorted, we can set two pointers, one from the start of the array, the other from the end of the array. Depending on the sum of the numbers at the current two indices, we know which way we will need to shift the two pointers. <br />

Time Complexity: O(n)


## Method 2: Binary Search
