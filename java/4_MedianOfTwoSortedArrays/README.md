## Method 1: Two Pointers

Merge the two sorted arrays into one single sorted array using parallel pointers, and then get the median.

Time Complexity: O(n)

## Method 2: Two Pointers Improved

Improved from Method 1 and solved without creating a new array.

Time Complexity: O(n)

## Method 3: Binary Search
