## Method 1: Iterative - Pointers

We do not need the dummy node or prev pointer in this problem because we will keep the first occurrence of a node even if it has duplicates. A current pointer that is used to loop through the list would be sufficient. </br>

Time Complexity: O(n)

## Method 2: Recursion
