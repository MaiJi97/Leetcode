## Method 1: Iterative Approach

Loop through the array and check adjacent elements to determine if there are duplicates.

Time Complexity: O(n)


## Method 2: Binary Search

Choose to use template 2 of bianry search so we don't need to worry about whether to return left or right at the end.

Time Complexity: O(logn)
