## Method 1: Brute Force
Use two for loops to trace the start and end of the substring and use another loop to determine if the substring is palindromic or not. <br />
Time complexity is O(n^3)

## Method 2: Two Pointers
Use one for loop to trace through the string, and two pointers to go towards the two sides, until we find the longest palindromic substring

## Method 3: Dynamic Programming
