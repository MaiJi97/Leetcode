## Method 1: Dynamic Programming

This problem is different from the first three combination sum problems, because we do not need to find all the result, just the number of outputs. We can 
use dynamic programming for this:

Recurrence relation: 

dp[i] represents number of ways to sum up to i. 

Time Complexity: O(T * N)
