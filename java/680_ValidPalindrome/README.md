## Method 1: Two Pointers with a helper to check normal palindrome
When we reach the case that two characters are not equal, we check to see if incrementing the left pointer or decrementing the right pointer will resolve the problem by calling a helper method to check normal palindrome. </br>

Time Complexity: O(n)
